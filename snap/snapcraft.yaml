summary: rstash is ccache with cloud storage
description: |
  rstash is a ccache-like compiler caching tool. It is used as a compiler
  wrapper and avoids compilation when possible, storing cached results either
  on local disk or in one of several cloud storage backends.
  
  rstash includes support for caching the compilation of C/C++ code, Rust, as
  well as NVIDIA's CUDA using nvcc.
  
  rstash also provides icecream-style distributed compilation (automatic
  packaging of local toolchains) for all supported compilers (including Rust).
  The distributed compilation system includes several security features that
  icecream lacks such as authentication, transport layer encryption, and
  sandboxed compiler execution on build servers. See the distributed quickstart
  guide for more information.
  
  rstash is also available as a GitHub Actions to facilitate the deployment
  using GitHub Actions cache.
